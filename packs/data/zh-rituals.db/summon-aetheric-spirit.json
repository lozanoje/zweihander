      "@en": "Beyond the Material Realm lay the Æthereal Veil. Within it, raw chaos – creation left unchecked – float wildly\n  among the endless void. Collecting into four\n  distinct elemental spirits, they represent an\n  age unknown, when stars collided and where these energies crashed together to forge the world as we know it. These same untamed spirits can be drawn into the Material Realm, taking physical manifestation in either air, earth, fire or water. Without any real sense\n  of identity or intelligence, Ætheric Spirits generally assumes the shape of the first creatures that crawled forth from primordial ooze in the dawn age. Lacking any sense of intelligence, a summoner can control these spirits to obey their every whim, guaranteeing their steely minds are not torn asunder by the realization that they control the same raw natural forces which forged both men and gods."

        "@en": "After successfully casting this Ritual, you summon forth an elemental spirit: either an Air Sylph, an Earthen Gnome, a Fire Salamander or a Water\n  Undine within three yards from you.\n  Once an Ætheric Spirit is summoned, you must attempt to exert mental control over its elemental\n  brain.YouwillmakeaSecretTestusingyourResolve Skill. The Difficulty Rating will be determined by the GM, taking into consideration any dangers around you. Naturally, this Difficulty Rating will be substantially easier if you are under no duress of any kind. If you succeed, the Ætheric Spirit will obey your every command. If you Critically Succeed, the Ætheric Spirit will obey your every command and may ignore its Trait of Physical Instability. If you fail, the Ætheric Spirit will simply refuse to obey you, although you can attempt to exert control a minute later. If you Critically Fail however, the Ætheric Spirit will break its bonds and takes random actions, but disappears at the end of an hour until summoned again. Your GM may require you to exert control again whenever you suffer Damage while controlling the Ætheric Spirit. During this time, roll [[/roll 1D100]] to determine what happens at\n  the beginning of each of its Turns:\n\nÆTHERIC SPIRIT RAGE\n1 to 20\nThe Ætheric Spirit attacks the nearest ally of the summoner.\n21 to 40 \nThe Ætheric Spirit attacks the nearest foe of the summoner.\n41 to 60\nThe Ætheric Spirit attacks the summoner\n61 to 80\nThe Ætheric Spirit does nothing.\n81 to 100\nThe Ætheric Spirit immediately disappears until summoned once more."

A Gryphon’s egg cracked into a marble bowl is required to summon an Air Sylph. A Basilisk’s eye buried beneath a heavy rock is required to summon an Earthen Gnome. A Chimaera’s heart burnt within a bronze censer is required to summon a Fire Salamander. A Shimmering Mimic’s brain drowned in a bucket of urine is required to summon a Water Undine. Also, you will need a shard of Wytchstone affixed into a staff or a rod, held aloft while exerting mental control over the Ætheric Spirit."

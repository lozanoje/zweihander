The only way to learn how to properly trace a Sigil is from a master Hexer. However, most Hexers jealously guard their Sigil techniques. These Sigils are never found inscribed upon sacred scrolls or written down in the grimoires of old. Sigils are a discipline taught from Hexers to initiates; an art kept secret within their schools. So secret is the process of learning Sigils that an entire Hexer school may possess a unique monopoly on its Sigils. This also means that no one Hexer could possibly learn all of the known Sigils. Once you commit to learning a new Sigil, you can only spend time learning that specific Sigil. You cannot study multiple Sigils at once.</p>\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS: </strong>As described before, Sigils are categorized into six forms. You must have at least one Skill Rank in Incantation to learn Minor Intensity Sigils, two Skill Ranks to learn Middling Intensity Sigils and three Skill Ranks to learn Major Intensity Sigils. In addition, in order to learn a higher Intensity Sigil, you must first know its lesser Intensity. As an example, that means that you cannot learn Ignis Middling Intensity Sigil unless you already know the Minor Intensity version first (or Major Intensity without first knowing the Minor and Middling Intensity).</p>\n<p><strong>MEDITATE AT PLACE OF POWER:&nbsp;</strong>In order to learn a Sigil, you must begin the learning process (which is traditionally limited to Hexers, unless your GM states otherwise). First, you must stand in a place of power &ndash; a place distinctly dedicated to one of the six forms of a Sigil. This place of power may be a sacred tree, a standing circle of rocks, a dedicated stone within a Hexer school or some other place your GM describes. You then spend time meditating in the place of power. Generally, it takes one hour to meditate upon a Minor Intensity Sigil, two hours for a Middling Intensity Sigil and three hours for a Major Intensity Sigil. Meditation does not require any Skill Tests, but you must remain undisturbed during this time. However, merely meditating upon a Sigil does not necessarily mean you can learn it yet. This is only the beginning of the process.</p>\n<p><strong>PRACTICE NEW SIGIL:&nbsp;</strong>Following the period of meditation, you will begin practicing the process of &lsquo;stacking&rsquo; your fingers and tracing the signs in-air. For practice, you will spend one week to practice the new Minor Intensity Sigil, two weeks for a new Middling Intensity Sigil or three weeks total for a Major Intensity Sigil. The hours, along with the days spent are sacred. These days need not be consecutive, however the days you commit cannot be disturbed or else you must begin anew.</p>\n<p><strong>FINALIZE STUDY:&nbsp;</strong>Once you finish practicing, you will make an Incantation Test to see if your studies were successful, with the category of Sigil setting the Difficulty Rating: Minor Intensity Sigils are (Routine +10%), Middling Intensity Sigils are (Standard +/-0%) and Major Intensity Sigils are (Challenging -10%). This Difficulty Rating may be given bonuses or penalties, depending on the place you study, other requirements and sundry factors &ndash; or lack thereof &ndash; by the GM.</p>\n<p>Upon success, spend Reward Points to finalize the process. You must spend 100 Reward Points for a Minor Intensity Sigil, 200 Reward Points for a Middling Intensity Sigil or 300 Reward Points for a Major Intensity Sigil, to complete the ceremony. If you rolled a Critical Success, you both finalize your study without the need spend Reward Points to record it. Failing the Incantation Test means you must begin practicing anew right from the start. Critically Failing the Incantation Test, however, means that you can never learn this Sigil. Be sure to track the Sigils you know under Unique Advances on your Character sheet.</p>\n<p>You can only ever learn a total number of Minor Intensity Sigils, Middling Intensity Sigils and Major Intensity Sigils equal to your [WB].</p>"

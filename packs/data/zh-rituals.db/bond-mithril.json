The object then immediately takes upon the relevant Qualities of mithril as a Special Material (as stated in<strong> Chapter 2: Liber Armorum</strong>). Weapons made from mithril gain the Fast Quality, whereas shields made from mithril gain the Light Quality. Mail, munitions plate and full plate armor made from mithril gain the Flexible Quality. Any armament from mithril decreases its Encumbrance Value by 1 (to a minimum of 1). Mithril can also be bonded to practically any form, whether it be armor, shield or a weapon. It can even be bonded to shirts of cloth, leatherworks, wooden devices, instruments, mechanical clockworks, jewelry and other works crafted using your Skills. Objects made from mithril cannot be destroyed by normal means and must be made the target of the Petty Magick spell called Dispel Magick in order for it to be destroyed otherwise.</p>"
